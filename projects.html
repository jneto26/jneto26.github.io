                <p>   This project was one I worked on junior year of college in my Agile Software development class.
                A group of 8 students and I decided to make a web app that would help entrepreneurial minded individuals
                find others looking for the same thing. Whether they were founders, employees looking to join a startup, or an
                entrepreneur just rying to grow their network, Micro was supposed to be the solution for them.</p>

                <p>   This project was one also worked on junior year of college in my Agile Software development class. For this
                web app we were brought a task to complete for a client. In this case our projects was to make a web app based
                quiz for a Northwestern startup called Unfound. This quiz would prompt the user with ten different personality discovering questions to
                see what a user tastes are like. In the end it would a recommend a new restaruant or place to go a for drink
                that they wouldn't have known about before.
